Title: Design Factors of 5G Bringing Innovation to the Medical Field

Team Members: Guy Butler, Irwin Narayan, Vinod Antony, Adrian Johnson

Customer: Druvil Ghandi

Abstract: The medical field is a ever growing, vastly changing
sector of our culture. Technology has a direct impact on its
growth thus causing the rapid evolution of this aspect of our
economy and truly innovating this field in its entirety. We asked
ourselves, ”Is there a better way to utilize 5G than incorporate
it into the medical field?” Many healthcare providers rely on
numerous electronic devices to provide pertinent, critical information
about the patients. More recently, many of these devices
have transitioned from analog to digital and have incorporated
the capability of remote monitoring due to the use of wireless
and Bluetooth technologies. Based upon this knowledge, we
brainstormed the idea of utilizing the 5G network to enhance
the transmission of data. 5G Cellular has increased bandwidth
capabilities and faster upload and download speeds, directly
impacting the speed at which much needed accurate data could be
received. Our project hopes to use 5G cellular along with 5G LAN
integration to connect healthcare providers with individuals or
patients and their caregivers to enhance their ability to send and
receive pertinent data in a rapid, seamless, fashion. 5G cellular
will tremendously enhance the capabilities of that equipment.
This can only be achieved if there is seamless coverage inside and
outside of our entire nationwide footprint. We wish to explore
the underling technology that makes 5G NR (New Radio) so
amazing. 5G cellular has issues traveling thru building structures.
Because of this, there needs to be a way to fully integrate 5G
LAN so that it works hand in hand with 5G cellular, in order to
provide seamless communication for the mobile devices that we
are exploring to work seamlessly both inside and outside.
